# FarmIQ-Price-Forecasting
- In this project, we used data from Indian agriculture website which had all information of different types of crops, historical area wise cultivation, prices etc. We also pulled in historical weather data from open sources and built this forecasting model. We included macroeconomic factors like GDP, producer price index as well.

- Using the forecasted prices and the area of cultivation of different crops in different states in India, the farmers can proactively plan which crops do they want to cultivate and invest in their time in.  Forecasting methods like ARIMA, Vector auto regression and fbprophet are used and we used backtesting to check the validity of our model.
